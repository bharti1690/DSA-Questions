## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for JavaScript implementations)
- Python 3.x (for Python implementations)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Questions.git
    cd DSA-Questions
    ```

2. Install dependencies for JavaScript (if any):
    ```sh
    cd javascript
    npm install
    ```

3. Install dependencies for Python (if any):
    ```sh
    cd python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running Tests

### JavaScript

To run the JavaScript tests, navigate to the `tests/javascript_tests/` directory and run:
```sh
npm test
